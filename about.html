            <p>Marvel Studios, LLC (originally known as Marvel Films from 1993 to 1996) is an American film and television production company. Marvel Studios is the creator of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a media franchise and shared universe of films and television series produced by the studio, based on characters that appear in Marvel Comics publications. The studio was founded by Avi Arad as part of Marvel Entertainment and has been led by producer Kevin Feige, who serves as its president, since 2007. The studio originally licensed the film rights to several Marvel characters before beginning to produce its own films in 2004, and has since regained many of those rights. It has been owned by the Walt Disney Company since 2009, and has been a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios since August 2015, where it is part of Disney Entertainment. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures has distributed most of the studio's films since The Avengers (2012).</p>
            <p>Since 2008, Marvel Studios has released 33 films within the MCU, from Iron Man (2008) to The Marvels (2023); ten television series since 2021, from WandaVision (2021) to Echo (2024); and two television specials: Werewolf by Night (2022) and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022). The television series What If...? (2021â€“present) is the first animated property produced solely by the studio, through its "mini-studio" Marvel Studios Animation.[7] These films, television series, and television specials all share continuity with each other, along with five short films called Marvel One-Shots produced by the studio that were released from 2011 to 2014. From 2013 until 2020, Marvel Television released 12 television series, which also acknowledge the MCU continuity. These were produced before that company was folded into Marvel Studios in December 2019 and became a production label.</p>
            <p>Ten of Marvel Studios' films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. These include: The Avengers, Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Captain Marvel (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021);[8] Avengers: Endgame was the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021.[9][10] In addition to the MCU, Marvel Studios has also been involved with the production of other Marvel-based film franchises that have grossed over $1 billion at the box office, including the X-Men and Spider-Man multi-film franchises, as well as eight direct-to-video short films with Marvel Animation called Marvel Animated Features that were released from 2006 until 2011. Since 2024, Marvel Studios has used "Marvel Television" and "Marvel Animation" banners to release their television and animated projects, respectively.</p>
